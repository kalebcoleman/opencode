- Warning observed on every run: agent "explore"/"librarian" is a subagent, not a primary agent; CLI falls back to default agent
- Empty outputs: none
- Repeated tool-call failures: none

SUMMARY:
- Successful responses: 3/3 (required prompts) and 6/6 for explicit explore/librarian targeting attempts
- Provider errors: 0
- Critical regressions: NONE (no empty output, no repeated tool-call failure, no provider errors)
- Overall: PASS (with warning that explicit --agent explore/librarian falls back to default agent)
